Postmortem Readme
Introduction
In the world of software engineering, failures are not a matter of "if" but "when." These failures can stem from various factors such as bugs, traffic spikes, security issues, hardware failures, natural disasters, and, of course, the inevitable human error. However, failure is not a dead end; it's an opportunity to learn, improve, and fortify our systems. This readme introduces the concept of postmortems, a valuable tool used in the tech industry to dissect and learn from system outages.

Why Postmortems?
Any seasoned Software Engineer understands that failing is a normal part of the development process. What sets great engineers apart is their ability to learn from their mistakes and prevent them from recurring. Failing is acceptable, but failing twice due to the same issue is not. Enter the postmortem â€“ a powerful practice that aids in both understanding the cause of an outage and implementing measures to prevent its recurrence.

Goals of a Postmortem
Provide Information to Stakeholders:

Outages can have a profound impact on a company's operations. Managers and executives need clear and concise information about what happened during an outage and how it might affect their teams and projects. The postmortem serves as a comprehensive summary accessible to all company employees.
Discover and Fix Root Causes:

The primary objective of a postmortem is to identify the root cause(s) of an outage. This involves a meticulous investigation into the events leading up to and during the outage. Once the root cause is identified, measures can be taken to ensure it is addressed and won't recur in the future.

Remember, the goal of a postmortem is not just to assign blame but to foster a culture of continuous improvement. Embrace failures as opportunities to enhance the resilience and reliability of your systems.

Happy postmorteming! ðŸš€
